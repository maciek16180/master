In this thesis I present selected neural mechanisms used in creating dialogue systems, or computer programs designed to hold a conversation with a user. I also show how methods described here perform in practice.

I implemented and tested algorithms for statistical modeling of a dialogue, as well as dialogue generation. In addition, I experimented with an architecture able to answer questions formulated in natural language. This part also contains my attempt of expanding the capabilities of the system.
