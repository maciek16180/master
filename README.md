`generators/` - dialogue generation

Run on Python 2.7.13. Install `requirements.txt`. You might not be able to install development version of Lasagne with pip, use
`pip install --upgrade https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/archive/master.zip` instead. Pre-trained models are provided. If you want to train the models yourself, you will need to set up your GPU for Theano (I used CUDA).
